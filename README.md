Player Experience:

Upon entry, the player will be spawn in front of a door into a facility. The facility is surrounded by mountains and has only one way in/out. The player approaches the door and the door opens automatically. Drones are wandering in the facility, reaching preset check points in the facility. Once the player enters a certain range of the drone it will start searching for the player by rotating 360 degrees. if it "sees" the player, it will stop and shoot the player with accuracy, and will not deactivate lock-on until the player goes out of sight behind a wall or something. The player has 100 health and 100 shield. Before shield breaks, it will take 60 percent fo the damage. after it breaks, te player will take the unmodified damage. The player will have 2 weapons. The primary one, which is also the default one, is a gun with low RPS and high damage per round. The secondary one is a gun with high RPS and low damage per round. The default weapon's model is M4A1 which does not suit the description but I don't have other assets so I just used it.
